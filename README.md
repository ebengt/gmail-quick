# gmail-quick
Send file content with gmail, after 'allow less security' was removed.

Slightly enhanced [quickstart](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/go).
I added flags to make it similar to [besmtp](https://github.com/ebengt/besmtp).
Allows credentials.json and token.json to be called something else.
